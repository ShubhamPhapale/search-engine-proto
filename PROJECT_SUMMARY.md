   - ✅ Respectful crawling with delays
   - ✅ HTML parsing and content extraction
   - ✅ Link discovery and following
   - ✅ Duplicate URL prevention
   - ✅ Database storage (SQLite)

2. **Search Engine Core** (`search_engine.py`)
   - ✅ TF-IDF indexing with scikit-learn
   - ✅ Text preprocessing (stemming, stopwords)
   - ✅ Cosine similarity ranking
   - ✅ PageRank-style authority scoring
   - ✅ Query highlighting in snippets
   - ✅ Spelling suggestions

3. **Web Interface** (`web_app.py` + `templates/search.html`)
   - ✅ Google-like responsive design
   - ✅ Search results with pagination
   - ✅ Query highlighting
   - ✅ Mobile-friendly interface
   - ✅ RESTful API endpoints

4. **Command Line Interface** (`main.py`)

   - ✅ Crawler management
   - ✅ Web server control
   - ✅ Testing utilities

### 📊 **Current Database Status**
- **20 indexed pages** from Wikipedia, Python docs, Real Python
- **Functional search index** with TF-IDF vectors
- **Working spell checker** with edit distance
- **Page ranking** based on domain authority

### 🚀 **Live Demo Results**

The search engine successfully handled queries like:
- **"python programming"** → Found relevant Python tutorial and Wikipedia pages
- **"web development"** → Returned web development Wikipedia article
- **"machine learning"** → Found ML Wikipedia page
- **"flask framework"** → Located Flask documentation

### 🌐 **Web Interface**
- Successfully running on `http://127.0.0.1:8080`
- Google-like search interface working
- Real-time search with highlighted results
- Pagination and result scoring displayed

## 🛠 **How to Use Your Search Engine**

### Quick Start
```bash
cd /Users/shubhamsarjeraophapale/search_engine
source search_env/bin/activate
python3 main.py server --port 8080
```
Then visit: `http://127.0.0.1:8080`

### Add More Content
```bash
# Crawl additional websites
python3 main.py crawl https://example.com https://another-site.com --max-pages 50

# Test search functionality  
python3 main.py test

# Run API demo
python3 demo_api.py
```

### API Usage
```python
from search_engine import SearchEngine

engine = SearchEngine('database.db')
results = engine.search("your query", max_results=10)
```
